Problem Statement:

You need to develop a program that manages employee data using the Employee class. 
The program should have two main functionalities: displaying employee data and performing employee management operations.

Employee Class:
Implement a class called Employee that represents an employee. 
The Employee class should have the following attributes: name, ID number, department, and job title.

Employee Data Display:
Write a program that creates three instances of the Employee class to store the following data:
Employee 1:

Name: Susan Meyers
ID Number: 47899
Department: Accounting
Job Title: Vice President
Employee 2:

Name: Mark Jones
ID Number: 39119
Department: IT
Job Title: Programmer
Employee 3:

Name: Joy Rogers
ID Number: 81774
Department: Manufacturing
Job Title: Engineer
The program should create three Employee objects and display the data for each employee on the screen.

Employee Management System:
Enhance the program to include an employee management system using a dictionary.
 The dictionary should use the employee ID number as the key.
The program should present a menu to the user with the following options:

Look up an employee in the dictionary
Add a new employee to the dictionary
Change the details (name, department, job title) of an existing employee in the dictionary
Delete an employee from the dictionary
Quit the program
When the program terminates, it should serialize (pickle) the dictionary and save it to a file.
 When the program starts, it should attempt to load the serialized dictionary from the file
. If the file does not exist, the program should start with an empty dictionary.
