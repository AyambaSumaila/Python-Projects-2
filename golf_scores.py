Problem Statement Golf Scores
The Springfork Amateur Golf Club has a tournament every weekend. The club president
has asked you to write two programs:
A program that will read each player’s name and golf score as keyboard input, and then
save these as records in a file named golf.txt. (Each record will have a field for the
player’s name and a field for the player’s score.)
 A program that reads the records from the golf.txt file and displays them
